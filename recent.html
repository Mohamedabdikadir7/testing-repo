    <h2>Special concerts in Palo Alto</h2>
    <p>Save the date! The long-awaited inaugural performances of the multimedia composition Fantasia Apocalyptica in my home church will take place on Friday, October 20, and Saturday, October 21, at 7:30pm. (These concerts had been planned to be the climax of the church's centennial celebrations in 2020, but they had to be postponed because of you-know-what.)</p>
    <p>The organist will be Jin Kyung Lim, who played the Fantasia at its California premiere in San Francisco in 2021. Years ago, as I was writing the music, she also gave the first-ever public performance of a “beta test” version, as part of a recital on the Murray Harris organ at Stanford's Memorial Church (04 November 2015).</p>
    <p>The October concerts will be the culmination of a project that's been part of my life for 60 years! They will take place at First Lutheran Church in Palo Alto, and further details can be found on that website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>(On the five Sunday mornings preceding the concerts, I'll be giving informal impromptu introductions to the piece. See the schedule below.)</p>
    <h1>A tribute to 2023</h1>
    <p>This 10×10 reentrant knight's tour, found with the help of Peter Weigel, has the amazing property that a queen at position 85 attacks all of the prime numbers (shown in green). Furthermore, all of the odd numbers attacked by that queen are prime—except the ‘1’, which some people think is prime. Furthermore, the exact date of my birth just happens to be present, along with 2023.</p>
    <p>I'm gettin' kinda old: now nearly one-third of a byte (256÷3). My age is a beautiful binary palindrome, also the product of two Fermat primes!</p>
    <h1>Happy Pi Day</h1>
    <p>Germán González-Morris sent me a delicious Pi Day treat, which you can find in the amendment to page 411 on page 5 of the Errata for Volume 4B of The Art of Computer Programming</p>
    <h1>Farewell to J. O.</h1>
    <p>My dear friend Jan Overduin, organist and teacher extraordinaire, passed away early in May. I've prepared a webpage in his memory, highlighting experiences that we shared.</p>
