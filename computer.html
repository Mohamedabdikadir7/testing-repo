    <h1>computer musings</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I occasionally give lectures at Stanford during the academic year. These lectures are open to the public as well as to students and faculty. No tuition is charged, no attendance is taken, no credit is given. Each talk is independent of the others, and pitched at an audience of non-specialists. Sometimes I talk about difficult technical issues, but I try to minimize the jargon and complications by stressing the motivation and the paradigms and the high-level picture, without sweeping the details entirely under the rug.</p>
    <p>At present I think the next topic will probably be “dancing cells,” sort of a sequel to the talk that I gave about “dancing links” in 2018. One of these days I'll post an abstract in this space.</p>
    <p>Another fun talk that I hope to give before long will be entitled</p>
    <h1>Strong Components and Weak Components</h1>
    <p>and here's a brief summary:</p>
    <blockquote>A directed graph can often be best understood and used if we partition its vertices into separate components of various kinds. Most important are the strongly connected components, called “strong components” for short; and strong components are in turn partitioned into “weak components.”
        Two definitions of weak components have appeared in the literature of graph theory. One of them is rather weak and uninteresting, while the other is becoming more and more relevant and appreciated (see the discussion here). Basically, the strong components are the smallest clusters of vertices that you can shrink to a point and obtain a digraph with no oriented cycles. The weak components, correctly defined, are the smallest clusters that you can shrink to a point and obtain an oriented path.
        I'll discuss Tarjan's beautiful algorithms for computing the strong and weak components of a given directed graph. (This will be fun because my personal favorite, among all of the algorithms of all kinds that I've ever encountered so far in my life, is his method for discovering the strong components as it explores the graph.)</blockquote>
        <p>Furthermore, if time permits, I'll disclose the answer to the following riddle: In what major world city are shirts of size XL smaller than shirts of size L?</p>
        <h1>Musings Online</h1>
        <p>Great news! Videotapes were made of many past lectures in this series, and the Stanford Center for Professional Development has for a long time made them freely available as part of the "stanfordonline" channel on YouTube. Captions are now available too. You can find them on their website; or you can use the following convenient playlists that they've prepared, showing all of the videos in the collection:</p>
